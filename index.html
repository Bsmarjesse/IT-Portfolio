how to make github appear as a website

ChatGPT said:
If you want your GitHub to appear like a website, there are two main ways to do it depending on what you mean:

✅ Option 1: Turn Your GitHub Repository Into a Live Website (GitHub Pages)
This makes your project publicly accessible like:

https://yourusername.github.io
🔹 Step-by-Step Setup
Go to GitHub

Create a new repository

If you want a main personal website, name it:

yourusername.github.io
Upload your website files:

index.html (required)

style.css

script.js (optional)

Go to:
Repository → Settings → Pages

Under Source, select:

Branch: main

Folder: / (root)

Click Save

Your site will be live in about 1–2 minutes 🎉

Example Basic Website Code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Benjamin Smarjesse | IT Support</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, I'm Benjamin</h1>
  <p>IT Support Specialist | CompTIA A+ Certified</p>
</body>
</html>
Upload that as index.html and you instantly have a website.

✅ Option 2: Make Your GitHub Profile Look Like a Website (Professional Portfolio Style)
If you're applying for IT roles (like Rivian 👀), this is powerful.

You can:

🔹 Create a README Profile Page
Create a repo named exactly your username

Add a README.md

This shows up on your profile homepage

You can style it like:

# 👋 Hi, I'm Benjamin Smarjesse

💻 IT Support Specialist  
🎓 Bachelor's Degree  
🔐 CompTIA A+ | Studying Network+  

## 🛠 Skills
- Windows 10/11 Troubleshooting
- Active Directory
- Network Support
- Hardware & Software Diagnostics
That makes your GitHub look polished and professional.

✅ Option 3: Make It Look Extra Professional (Like a Real Portfolio Site)
You can:

Use a free template (HTML/CSS)

Use Bootstrap

Use a portfolio template from:

HTML5 UP

Start Bootstrap

Then deploy via GitHub Pages.

🚀 Best Option for You (IT Career)
Since you're in IT support:

I recommend:

Create yourusername.github.io

Add:

About Me

Resume download

Certifications

Home Lab Projects

Screenshots of troubleshooting labs

Link it on LinkedIn + Resume

That makes you stand out from 90% of Tier 1 applicants.

If you'd like, I can:

Build you a simple professional portfolio template

Or walk you through step-by-step live setup

Or help make it tailored for IT Support roles

What level do you want — simple, clean, or impressive recruiter-ready?

what do I add here?

ChatGPT said:
Good — this is the part that confuses almost everyone the first time 🙂

You’re in Verified domains, and the important thing:

👉 You do NOT need to add anything here.

That section is only for people who bought a custom domain like:

benjaminsmarjesse.com
helpdeskben.com
itsupportportfolio.net
GitHub is basically asking:

“Do you own a real internet domain and want GitHub to publish your site to it?”

You don’t need that to make a website.

What you actually need (the real step)
Instead, you need to enable GitHub Pages inside your repository, not in account settings.

Follow this exactly:

Step 1 — Create the website repository
Go to GitHub home

Click + (top right) → New repository

Repository name must be:

YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io
Example:
If your username is:

bsmar371
Then the repo MUST be:

bsmar371.github.io
This is the #1 thing people mess up.

Make it:

Public ✅

Add README ❌ (leave unchecked is fine)

Click Create repository

Step 2 — Add the homepage file
After it opens:

Click:
Add file → Create new file

Name the file:

index.html
Then paste this:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Benjamin Smarjesse | IT Support</title>
    <style>
        body {
            font-family: Arial;
            background-color: #0d1117;
            color: white;
            text-align: center;
            padding-top: 100px;
        }
        h1 { font-size: 50px; }
        p { font-size: 22px; color: #8b949e; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Benjamin Smarjesse</h1>
<p>IT Support Specialist</p>
<p>CompTIA A+ Certified | Studying Network+</p>

</body>
</html>
Scroll down → Commit new file

Step 3 — Turn the website ON (this is the real switch)
Now go to:

Repository → Settings → Pages

Under Source, choose:

Deploy from a branch
Then:

Branch: main

Folder: /root

Click Save

Step 4 — Your website link
Wait about 60–90 seconds

Then go to:

https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io
That is now a real live website you can put on:

Resume

LinkedIn

Job applications

Why this matters for IT jobs
Hiring managers LOVE this because it instantly shows:

you understand Git

you can deploy

you can follow documentation

you can self-learn tech

It honestly boosts helpdesk candidates a lot.

If you tell me your GitHub username, I’ll make the exact link for you and help you build a clean IT portfolio page (resume download + home lab section).


You said:
my github username is Bsmarjesse

ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 — yours will be very clean.

Your future website link will be:

https://bsmarjesse.github.io
Right now it doesn’t work because the special repository doesn’t exist yet.
We’re going to make one exact-name repo — GitHub treats that as your personal website.

Do this EXACTLY
1️⃣ Create the correct repository
Go here:
https://github.com/new

Fill it out:

Repository name (VERY IMPORTANT):

bsmarjesse.github.io
Settings:

Public ✅

Add README ❌ (leave unchecked)

.gitignore ❌

License ❌

Click Create repository

2️⃣ Add your homepage
After the repo opens:

Click
Add file → Create new file

For the filename enter:

index.html
Now paste this (this is a real starter IT portfolio homepage):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Benjamin Smarjesse | IT Support Portfolio</title>

    <style>
        body{
            background:#0d1117;
            color:white;
            font-family:Segoe UI, Arial;
            text-align:center;
            padding:60px;
        }

        .card{
            background:#161b22;
            padding:30px;
            border-radius:12px;
            max-width:700px;
            margin:auto;
            box-shadow:0 0 25px rgba(0,0,0,.6);
        }

        h1{font-size:48px;margin-bottom:5px;}
        h2{color:#58a6ff;font-weight:normal;}
        p{color:#c9d1d9;font-size:18px;line-height:1.6;}

        .section{
            margin-top:40px;
        }

        a{
            color:#58a6ff;
            text-decoration:none;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>

<div class="card">

<h1>Benjamin Smarjesse</h1>
<h2>IT Support Specialist</h2>

<p>

</p>

<div class="section">

</p>
</div>

</div>

</body>
</html>
Scroll down → click Commit new file

3️⃣ Turn on the website (the switch)
Now:

Go to
Settings (top of the repo) → Pages (left sidebar)

Under Build and deployment

Choose:

Source: Deploy from a branch
Branch: main
Folder: /root
Click Save

4️⃣ Wait 1 minute
Then open:

https://bsmarjesse.github.io
🎉 That is now your personal IT website.
You can literally put that on your resume under your name.

Important (this helps you get interviews)
After it works, add this line under your name on your resume:

Portfolio: https://bsmarjesse.github.io
For helpdesk hiring managers, this is HUGE.
Most Tier 1 applicants have zero proof of skills — this instantly separates you.

When you finish, tell me what you see (or screenshot if it errors). I’ll help you fix it if GitHub does something weird — it often takes people one small adjustment.

how do i view my it-portfolio

ChatGPT said:
Good news — you actually did create a site, but this repository won’t open at
bsmarjesse.github.io yet because of one very specific GitHub rule:

Your main personal website ONLY works from a repo named exactly bsmarjesse.github.io
not IT-Portfolio.

Right now your IT-Portfolio repo is a project website, and you just need to open the Pages link GitHub generated.

How to view the one you already made
From the page in your screenshot:

Click Settings (top right of that repository)

On the left sidebar click Pages

You will see a section that says something like:

Your site is live at:
https://bsmarjesse.github.io/IT-Portfolio/
👉 THAT is your portfolio link right now.

Open this in your browser:

https://bsmarjesse.github.io/IT-Portfolio/
(Notice the /IT-Portfolio/ at the end — that’s why your main link didn’t work.)

Why your main link doesn’t work (important concept)
GitHub Pages has 2 different website types:

Type	Repo Name	URL
Personal website	bsmarjesse.github.io	bsmarjesse.github.io
Project website	anything else	bsmarjesse.github.io/reponame
You made a project site.

We want a personal site — recruiters expect that.

The BEST fix (takes 2 minutes)
Instead of rebuilding everything, just rename the repo.

Do this:
Inside IT-Portfolio

Click Settings

Very top → Repository name

Change:

IT-Portfolio
to:

bsmarjesse.github.io
Scroll down → Rename

What will happen
After about 60 seconds:

Your site will now open at:

https://bsmarjesse.github.io
No /IT-Portfolio/
No extra steps
And it now looks like a real professional personal website.

Why this matters (seriously)
When a hiring manager sees:

github.io/IT-Portfolio
→ student project

When they see:

bsmarjesse.github.io
→ personal technical website / real candidate

This small change massively improves perception.

After you rename it, open the link and tell me what you see.
If it shows a 404 at first — that is normal (GitHub takes ~1 minute to redeploy).
